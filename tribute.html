His mother was a housewife and his father was attorney at Calcutta High court. Naren's grandfather was sanskrit scholar and had became a monk at the age of 25. His mother's religious temprament thinking and his father's logical, rational thinking helped him to shape his personality alot. Since childhood Naren was quite interested in spiritual and already started meditating in front of deities like Shiva, Mahavir Hanuman. He was always fascinated by monks and ascetics. Swami Vivekananda were enrolled in Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar Metropolitian Institution. He was the only student to receive first-division marks in Presidency college entrance examination.

  <p class="font">  First encounter of Swami Vivekanand with Ramkrishna Paramahamsa was during a literature class trip which prof William Hastie had suggested to go to Ramkrishna to understand the real meaning of word "trance". When Narendra was preparing for his upcoming examinations and he visited Surendra Nath mitra's house where apparently Ramkrishna were invited to deliver a lecture. Ramakirshna asked Narendra to sing and impressed by his singing skills, they invited him to Dakshineshwar. In early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineshwar to visit Ramkrishna and this proved to be a turning point in his life. After Narendra's father death, family went bankrupt and he requested Ramkrishna to pray to goddess Kali on his behalf because he was against idol worship as a part of brahmo samaj. Narendra gradually started to renouce everything for the sake of god and make Ramkrishna his guru. </p>
